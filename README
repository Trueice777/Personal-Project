Goals 
Complete the SDSU Sage tutorial, and gain a near-complete understanding of sage and its uses. 

Boundaries / Scope
Complete all four parts of SDSU Sage Tutorial: About this tutorial, Sage as a Calculator, Programming in Sage, and Mathematical Structures.

Success criteria 
Submit each monthly part of the personal project and include as much information as requested. Be able to use sage adeptly.  

Constraints 
The amount of time I leave open each week to progress on my project. 

Assumptions 
The SDSU Sage Tutorial can be accessed via a browser, so access isn't limited. Sage is free to download online. I can skip the sub-section Contributing to the tutorial.

Stakeholders 
Me, my parents, Professor Vanselow, anyone who may hire me in future.
